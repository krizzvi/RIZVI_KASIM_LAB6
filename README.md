This project implements a Python function to detect and measure the length of a cycle in a singly linked list using Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm). The function get_cycle_length(node) determines whether a cycle exists in the linked list by moving two pointers at different speeds through the list; if they meet, a cycle is present. The function then calculates the length of the cycle by traversing the cycle from the meeting point until the pointers meet again, counting the steps. If no cycle is detected, the function returns 0. This approach is efficient, operating in O(n) time with O(1) space, making it ideal for detecting cycles in linked lists.
